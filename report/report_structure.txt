intro
[module 0]
    1. attribute explanation+statistics+distributions

[module 1]
    2. brief outliers chapter
        2.x. different methods ...
    3. imbalanced learning
        3.x. different methods
        3.z. combination of some techniques

[module 2]
    4. advanced classification (5 methods)
        how are outliers handled?
        target variable?
        
        explainability

    5. advanced regression
        target variable?
        
        explainability
    
[module 3: TS]
    6. attribute explanation+statistics+distributions
        preprocessing etc

    7. Motifs+anomaly discovery
        distinguish between global and local outliers
        maybe merge with clustrering chapter?

    8. clustering

    9. classification
        xai
    
    10. sequential pattern mining
        maybe use as paragraph in order to get rule based classif?
        use seq pattern mining for xai?
