\subsection{Motifs and Anomalies Discovery}

\hl{To analyze recurrent temporal patterns in the movie time series, 
we adopted a motif-based approach grounded in the Matrix Profile 
framework}. Prior to motif extraction, all series were normalized 
using z-score normalization applied independently to each time series 
in order to focus the analysis on pattern shape rather than absolute 
scale. Motifs were extracted using the \texttt{STUMPY} implementation 
of the matrix profile. 
% A sliding window of length 28 was selected as a compromise between capturing meaningful temporal 
% dynamics and preserving local variations. 
A window length of 28 was selected to capture repeated seasonal 
dynamics rather than isolated cycles.
For each time series, the three subsequences associated with the 
lowest matrix profile values were selected, resulting in the extraction 
of the top-3 motifs per time series. \\
All extracted motifs were aggregated into 
a single dataset. To analyze similarities among 
motifs, K-Means clustering using Euclidean distance was applied. 
The number of clusters was selected by jointly evaluating the Sum 
of Squared Errors and the Silhouette Score, leading to the choice 
of four clusters as a reasonable trade-off between compactness and 
separation. Cluster centroids were analyzed as representative 
average patterns, and intra-cluster variability was quantified 
by computing the standard deviation across all motifs assigned to 
each cluster. Figure~\ref{fig:motif_clusters} shows the resulting 
cluster centroids together with their variability bands. In addition, 
clustering was also performed using Dynamic Time Warping as distance 
measure in order to account for possible temporal misalignments 
between motifs; this alternative formulation led to cluster 
structures and representative patterns that were largely consistent 
with those obtained using Euclidean distance. \\
