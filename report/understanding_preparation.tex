\section{Data Understanding and Preparation}
\label{sec:data_preparation}

The dataset contains 32 columns and 149531 rows of titles of different types.
For each title, the dataset contains information regarding many different
aspects. Table~\ref{tab:initial_categorical_features} lists the initial categorical
features.

Of the initial categorical attributes, the following were removed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{originalTitle}, as it did not provide particularly useful
    information;
    \item \texttt{isAdult}, as it was almost completely correlated with the
    \textit{Adult} genre, so a logical OR operation was performed, and the genre
    only was kept;
    \item \texttt{canHaveEpisodes}, as it was completely correlated with the title type
    being \textit{tvSeries} or \textit{tvMiniSeries};
    \item \texttt{isRatable}, as it was always true;
    \item \texttt{soundMixes}, as it required some domain knowledge to be understood, as well as having issues with the values it contained.
    \item \texttt{worstRating} and \texttt{bestRating}, as they were always
    1 and 10, respectively;
    \item \texttt{rating}, as it was obtainable from the \texttt{averageRating}
    continuous attribute, through a simple discretization.
\end{itemize}


Table~\ref{tab:initial_features_numerical} lists the initial numerical features.

Of the initial numerical attributes, the following were removed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{endYear}, as it had no values for non-Series titles, and having around 50\% of missing values for \textit{tvSeries} and
\textit{tvMiniSeries};
    \item \texttt{numVotes}, as it had a very high correlation with \texttt{ratingCount};

\subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\end{wrapfigure}

To gain an initial understanding of the dataset, 
we conducted several exploratory analyses focusing on key attributes related to ratings, genres, 
and temporal trends. 
\newline Figure~\ref{fig:rating_dist} shows the distribution of the \texttt{averageRating} attribute, 
which appears approximately Normal with a peak around 7. This feature is central to both the classification and regression tasks, 
making its distribution essential for understanding model behavior and potential biases.


In Figure~\ref{fig:genre_popularity} we visualized the distribution of titles across different genres.  
The chart reveals that nearly half of the titles fall under the Drama and Comedy genres, 
highlighting their dominant role in the entertainment industry and audience preferences. This insight helps guide further analysis, 
such as predicting genre popularity, tailoring recommendations, or identifying gaps in content diversity.

To understand viewer perceptions we plotted figure~\ref{fig:year_rating} the trend of average ratings over time.
It reveals historical shifts in audience engagement 
and rating standards. We observe a steady increase in average ratings from the early 1900s to the present, 
with notable peaks around the 1960s and 2020s. This upward trend may reflect improvements in production quality, 
storytelling, and accessibility, offering valuable context for analyzing rating dynamics across different eras.
\newline We observed that several features in the dataset exhibited a heavy right skew, 
characterized by a long tail of high values. Based on this insight, we proceeded to the feature engineering phase, 
where we merged relevant columns and applied preprocessing techniques such as one-hot encoding and normalization to 
prepare the data for modeling.



\subsection{Feature Engineering}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{totalImages}, \texttt{totalVideos} and \texttt{quotesTotal}, were merged
through a simple sum operation
into a single feature (\texttt{totalMedia}) because of their similar semantic
meaning, as well as heavy right skewness;
    \item \texttt{awardWins} and \texttt{awardNominations}, were merged with the same procedure
as above into \texttt{totalNominations}, since they represented the same concept;
    \item \texttt{userReviewsTotal} and\texttt{criticReviewsTotal},were merged with the same procedure
as above into \texttt{reviewsTotal}, since they represented the same concept;
    \item \texttt{regions} and \texttt{countryOfOrigin},
were merged through a simple union operation. The resulting feature was then
represented trhough frequency encoding on the entire list, as well as
counts of the number of countries from each continent.
This resulted in eight new features (six continents, one for unknown country codes,
and the last for the frequency encoding);
    \item \texttt{genre}, it was observed that each record
contained up to three genres, listed in alphabetical order—indicating that the order
did not convey any semantic information about the title.
To represent this information, three separate features were created, each
corresponding to one of the genres. These features were encoded using frequency
encoding, sorted in descending order of frequency across the dataset.  
A value of 0 was used to indicate missing genres—either when no genres were present or
to fill the remaining slots when fewer than three were available;
\item \texttt{titleType}, was one-hot encoded, as it was a nominal categorical
feature with no intrinsic order;
    \item \texttt{deltaCredits}, was created as the difference between
\texttt{totalCredits} and the sum of \texttt{castNumber}, \texttt{writerCredits} and \texttt{directorCredits}. 
This feature aimed to capture the number of other types of credits
(such as producers, editors, etc.) associated with a title, which could be relevant for
understanding its production scale and complexity;
    \item \texttt{runtimeMinutes}, had a very high number of missing values approx ~27\%. 
    Since the feature had high relevance in the domain, it was
imputed with the interquartile range, separately for each title
type. For advanced classification, in order to avoid any correlation with the target variable, 
we imputed the feature with random integers within the global interquartile range.

\end{itemize}



% \subsection{Exploratory Data Analysis}

% To gain an initial understanding of the dataset, we conducted several exploratory analyses focusing on key attributes related to ratings, genres, and temporal trends. Figure~\ref{fig:eda_overview} presents three core visualizations side by side, each highlighting a different aspect of the IMDb dataset.

% The first plot illustrates the distribution of the \texttt{averageRating} attribute, which appears approximately Normal with a peak around 7. This feature is central to both the classification and regression tasks, making its distribution essential for understanding model behavior and potential biases.

% The second plot shows the distribution of titles across genres. We observe that Drama and Comedy dominate the dataset, together accounting for nearly half of all titles. This imbalance is important for downstream modeling, as it may influence genre‑related predictions and highlight areas where content diversity is limited.

% The third plot depicts the trend of average ratings over time. The steady upward movement—from the early 1900s to recent years—suggests evolving audience expectations, improvements in production quality, and shifts in rating standards. These temporal patterns provide valuable context for interpreting rating dynamics across different eras.

% Together, these visualizations offer a comprehensive overview of the dataset structure and guide subsequent steps in feature engineering and model development.
