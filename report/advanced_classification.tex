\section{Advanced Classification}

In this section, classification results are showcased for two
target variables: \texttt{averageRating} (properly binned into
5 classes), and \texttt{titleType} (with 6 classes).


\subsection{Rating classification}
A binned rating classification task was chosen because of how meaningful
the feature is.
Since the feature is continuous, containing float values between 1 and 10,
it was binned in 5 classes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 0: [1.0, 6.0), containing all insufficient ratings; this class
    represented 
    \item 1: [6.0, 7.0)
    \item 2: [7.0, 8.0)
    \item 3: [8.0, 9.0)
    \item 4: [9.0, 10.0]
\end{itemize}
