"""
This module contains functions that assist with the preprocessing of training and testing datasets.

The functions in this file are designed to streamline and standardize the preprocessing steps
required for machine learning pipelines, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.


Steps:
1. Initialization of the datasets from starting csvs.
2. Applies imputation to the datasets.
3. Applies transformations to the datasets.
