1. is it fine to handle outliers through statistical single feature
    kinda; they are separated; run with all
2. frequency encoding for genres in 3 columns
    perfect
3. can it make sense to combine the scores obtained by the different outlier detection methods for a combined outlier detection
    we can try; of course we need to normalize and everything but it can roughly make sense

1% is not important; we can detect more/less outliers
we can try to run on scores, then pick %thresholds and check when the intersection of the 3 methods has a meaning/logic behind it


------------SECOND Q&A------------
1. idea to include a section about outlier det at the beginning, and then
   small paragraph for each mining task describing which method was used, why
   i.e. use outlier chapter to describe dataset props ~clustering
